I have commercial experience working in productive teams, successfully solving tasks using React and TypeScript, integrating with REST APIs, and managing complex state with Redux Toolkit. I quickly adapt to new technologies, independently study best practices, and explore backend infrastructure to better understand the full system. I can design component architecture with an emphasis on reusability and scalability, and I’m not afraid to take responsibility for critical parts of the project. In my work, I value clarity, attention to detail, and an engineering mindset. I strive not only to implement business logic but also to improve developer experience, codebase quality, and team processes.",
